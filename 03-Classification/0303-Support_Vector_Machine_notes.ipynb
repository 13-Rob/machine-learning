    "The two \"points\" from different categories closer to each other are the support vectors, and they define the ***Maximum Margin Hyperplane (Maximum Margin Classifier)***. This ***Maximum Margin Hyperplane*** is the vector that sets the categories apart from one another, and it is equidistant from the support vectors. The ***Maximum Margin Hyperplane*** is parallel to the ***Positive Hyperplane*** and to the ***Negative Hyperplane*** which are the edges of the categories.\n",
