    "$$ ln{ p \\over 1-p } = b_{0} + b_{1} X_{1} + ... + b_{n} X_{n} $$\n",

    "This equation will turn into a sigmoid curve, not actually a binary value, so the value we get from projecting data into the curve is the probability of that data being on one side of the curve.\n",

    "\n",
    "The maximum likelihood is a meassure to determine if the equation we found is the optimal for our dataset. This is done comparing all our dataset results with what would have the equation predicted for that data, and you do that for all possible curves.\n",
